# MatrixMultiplicator

Refactor Points:
- Naive multiplication (O(nÂ³) complexity), could benefit largely from using a more efficient algorithm
  
- Test transposing the second matrix (to better cache locality) when multiplying

- Fix the TCP code for decoding the multiplication data (packets are received many at once and the code is not supporting it correctly)

I will probably someday [RIIR]([https://link-url-here.org](https://transitiontech.ca/random/RIIR)https://transitiontech.ca/random/RIIR) and address all these points.
